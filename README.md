# How to launch the application?
**To start, you need to install the necessary libraries and deploy the database. Also, to work, you need to get tokens to control the bot, weâ€™ll look at this further.
Let's go through all the points, starting with the database** 
## 1. Database setup
---
Need to connect to existing postgres database and create testshark database. **You need to be on the *postgres* user or any other user with sufficient rules.**
```
sudo su postgres
psql postgres
```
Afterwards we create the testshark database.
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE testshark;
```
Afterwards you need to exit postgres and migrate the database. *The database dump is located inside the project (testshark.dump)*
```bash
psql -d testshark -f testshark.dump
```
---
*If your user does not have the appropriate rights, select a different user or use postgres*

```bash
psql -d testshark -f testshark.dump -U your_user
```
---
---
## 2. Libraries setup
Let's create a virtual environment and load libraries.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Receiving telegram tokens
Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org.

Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.

You need ***api_id*** and ***api_hash***

Substitute them into conf_example and ***rename it to conf.ini***

**Also substitute your user into the database config or create a user *dante*, giving him rules over the testshark database in advance.**
